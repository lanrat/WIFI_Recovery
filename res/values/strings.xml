		This application displays the wireless networks and keys which your phone stores
		in plain text in a file often called wpa_supplicant.conf. This application provides you with 
		the ability to view and share your wireless configurations. Additionally you can backup and restore
        your wpa_supplicant.conf file to/from your SD card. The wpa_supplicant.conf file should not be
        modified by hand. If for some reason your wireless configuration gets corrupted, use the Reset function.
